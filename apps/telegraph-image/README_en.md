## How to Obtain `Bot_Token` and `Chat_ID` for Telegram

> Do not abuse and avoid being abused by others, lest Telegram be banned

If you don't have a Telegram account yet, please create one first. Then, follow these steps to get the `Bot_Token` and `Chat_ID`:

1. **Get the `Bot_Token`**
   - In Telegram, send the command `/newbot` to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), and follow the prompts to input your bot's name and username. Once successfully created, you will receive a `Bot_Token`, which is used to interact with the Telegram API.

2. **Set the bot as a channel administrator**
   - Create a new channel and, after entering the channel, go to channel settings. Add the bot you just created as a channel administrator, so it can send messages.

3. **Get the `Chat_ID`**
   - Use [@GetTheirIDBot](https://t.me/GetTheirIDBot) to get your channel ID. Send a message to this bot and follow the instructions to receive your `Chat_ID` (the ID of your channel).
